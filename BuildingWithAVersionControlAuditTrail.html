Abstract<br>
<br>
This paper discusses the issues that sourouding the building of
software in a controlled fashion. It presents key requirments and
concepts, and shows how the Configuration management change loop can be
completed by managing the build process from the Version Control
system, in this example Subversion and GNU Make.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A process will be presented that:<br>
<br>
# Ensures that all inputs to the build process are identified using a
tag<br>
# Identifies all builds with the build environment in which the build
took place<br>
# Places the build outputs under configuration management<br>
<br>
In addition possible areas of future development will be discussed,
including the re-use of already built artifacts to speed up build time.<br>
<br>
!!What is Software Building<br>
<br>
When building software we take some input files, usually source code
but they could be anything, and create some output files. Note that
this paper does not discuss building code that is installed in some
external environment such as a database.<br>
<br>
In many organisations the build process is given far too little
attention. Common mistakes include<br>
<br>
* Not knowing what version of the code was used to build a specific
output file<br>
* Not knowing what software tools and third party libraries where used
to build software<br>
** Developers frequently supply production binaries created on their
desktop PC's<br>
* Not recording the results of the build for historical traceability.
This includes information such as:<br>
** The specific options that where chosen for each tool used in the
build<br>
** The software versions used in the build process<br>
<br>
In my many years of advising customers on their software process I am
constantly disappointed by how many fail to see the value of an
adequate build process or are not prepared to apply the effort to
implement and maintain one. The sad fact is that failure to address the
build process can break the entire SDLC and result in huge costs as
people run around trying to answer the question "what's different in
production that made it break today?".<br>
<br>
With the use of automated testing tools and frameworks the value of a
automated build process is increased even more.<br>
<br>
There are other sources that talk about the mechanics of the build
environment and creation of build scripts. I would like to talk about
the interface between the build system and the configuration management
system.<br>
<br>
For the purposes of this discussion there are three distinct build
processes&lt;br&gt;<br>
<br>
* Sandbox builds that occur in a developer sandbox. The products of
this build of not used outside the sandbox and are of no CM interest,
other than they should not pollute the system build products<br>
<br>
* Integration Builds or Smoke Tests -- to ensure that the software
builds. It should be noted that unit tests are often invoked as part of
this process<br>
<br>
* System builds. These builds are performed by automated processes and
create builds for two purposes<br>
<br>
** Creating deployment artifacts -- Creates outputs that is deployed to
environments for some level of testing or for production release. <br>
<br>
** Providing a record of the build process for production audit
purposes (NB Many current build systems fail in this requirement)<br>
<br>
!!! The importance of the Build Record<br>
<br>
From a configuration management perspective two of the key requirements
are Accounting and Audit. These are not just academic concerns. We must
be able to:<br>
<br>
# List all the artifacts and versions that compose a specific version
of our product<br>
# Show which changes have been made to product version and that the
work was carried our correctly.<br>
<br>
A full discussion of this is ouside the scope of this paper, however it
is important that the build process does not break the audit trail of
information between our released product and the changes that were
developed in our various environments.<br>
<br>
In certain circumstances there may be legal ramifications if we are
unable to supply this information.<br>
<br>
!! System Builds<br>
Ideally all system builds will be done in separate build environment
distinct from the various runtime environments. This build environment
should be subject to CM Change Control, e.g. a
[http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2006/10/27/what-is-a-lightweight-ticket-process/|Lightweight
Ticket Process].<br>
<br>
A system build must be done against a tagged version of the input files
(a baseline).<br>
<br>
When the build is complete then consider placing the outputs from the
build process under CM control. In subversion this can be done as
follows:<br>
* Copy the input files onto a new 'build' branch.&amp;nbsp; Consider
having a 'builds' top level directory in your repository<br>
* Copy the source branch to the build branch -- this is our input
baseline<br>
* The build environment should used a predefined CONFIG_ID (set in an
environment variable). This should relate to a change ticket<br>
* Generate a BUILD ID -- It consists of the CONFIG_ID concatenated with
the date&amp;nbsp;YYYYMMDDHHMMSS<br>
* As part of building each output perform an &lt;code&gt; svn add
&amp;lt;outputfile&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;, on the build branch
#&amp;nbsp; TODO -- test this<br>
* At the end of the build perform a svn ci. This will add the new files
built<br>
* Apply two custom properties to each build file in Subversion
a)The&amp;nbsp; CONFIG_ID and b) the BUILD_ID<br>
* Close the build log<br>
* Add and check in the build log to subversion on the Build branch and
add the BUILD_ID property<br>
<br>
!Further Work<br>
<br>
* Using other Build tools (e.g. Ant, CONS...)<br>
* Creating reports and release notes<br>
* Using other Revision Control systems such as Hg<br>
* <br>
<br>
!Issues<br>
<br>
* Building source languages such as Java<br>
* Using tools other than Make (e.g. CONS, Ant)<br>
* Scaling the project up to include more files across multiple
direcotries and more file types (e.g. yacc grammar)<br>
* Reusing built files across builds<br>
* Building for different platforms<br>
